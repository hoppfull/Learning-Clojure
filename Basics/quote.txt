quote special form
	Returns an element unevaluated. Not sure what this is useful for but apparently it's useful
	when dealing with macros...
	Forced laziness?
	Forcing clojure to interpret what would otherwise be a function call as a list instead?
	
	syntax:
		(quote element)
		'(element) ; same as above expression
		
	ex:
		(quote (+ 1 2)) ; returns a list of symbol + and values 1 2
		'(+ 1 2) ; returns a list of symbol + and values 1 2
